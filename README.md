#Travel with AI 
This repo was born with the AI webinar created for the API Addicts fundation in Spain in June 25. 

The goal is to illustrate key AI concepts such as LLMs, RAG, Agents and MCPs through the implementation of a sample application (myVacation.org) using various tools from the WSO2 portfolio.
